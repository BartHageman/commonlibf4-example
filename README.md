This is a conversion of commonlibf4's example project to rely on vcpkg for the commonlibf4 dependency as well. 
It is a mirror of my gitlab repo. I've added this readme for clarity.

As of the time of writing this, this relies on my fork of the colorglass repository. 
https://gitlab.com/colorglass/vcpkg-colorglass/
https://gitlab.com/ManiacalMobi/vcpkg-colorglass/

Upstream repo is not yet updated to the latest commit of commonlibf4 and won't build. Until my PR gets pulled in, I'll use mine.

Another small addition is a post-build python script which removes rc.exe from the compile_commands.json generated by ninja. Clangd won't properly recognize the dependencies as cpp files, interprets them as C instead. Removing rc.exe entry fixes this. Script is there until I find a better solution.
